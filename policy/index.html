    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>NisanApp is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide our services, we collect the following types of information:</p>

    <h3>A. Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect your username, email address, and a securely hashed password.</li>
        <li><strong>User Content:</strong> We collect the tasks, notes, subtasks, categories, and other data you create and input into the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> The App stores any files you attach (images, PDFs, etc.) in a private directory on your local device. We only store metadata (like file names) in our database to help you manage them; the file contents are not uploaded to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> To enhance your experience, we collect anonymous, aggregated data on how you interact with App features (e.g., feature usage frequency, session duration). This data is not personally identifiable.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Storage Data (Local):</strong> The App uses your device's local storage to save your theme preference, unsaved drafts, recent search history, and task priority usage to provide smart defaults. This data remains on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Sync the Service:</strong> To operate the App, store your data securely, and sync it across your devices in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> To offer smart defaults and remember your preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> To analyze usage trends and guide future development.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security:</strong> To protect your account and the integrity of our services.</li>
        <li><strong>To Communicate with You:</strong> To send important service-related notifications, if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use Google Firebase for our backend infrastructure. This includes Firebase Authentication for secure sign-in and Cloud Firestore for database storage. Your data is stored securely on Google's servers, and their use of it is governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid legal requests from public authorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data. We leverage the robust security measures of Google Firebase to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. Since attachments are stored locally, their security is also dependent on the security of your device.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Data Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Edit:</strong> You can review and edit your User Content at any time within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You can copy or share your task information at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can permanently delete your account and all associated data through the "Delete Account" feature. This action is irreversible and will also remove your data from our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>NisanApp is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
