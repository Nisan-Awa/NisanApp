    <h1>Privacy Policy for Niasn App</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 19, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <em class="placeholder">NissanApp</em> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use the Niasn App task management mobile application (the "App" or "Service").</p>

    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Niasn App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We limit the data we collect to two main categories: <strong>Authentication Data</strong> and <strong>User Task Data</strong>.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Authentication Data (Personal Data)</h3>
    <p>This is the only personally identifiable information (PII) we collect directly to create and manage your user account. This data is necessary for you to access and use the core features of the App.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Address</strong> (or similar unique identifier provided by a third-party sign-in service, e.g., Google, Apple, if applicable).</li>
                <li><strong>Password</strong> (stored securely using industry-standard hashing and encryption).</li>
                <li><strong>User ID</strong> (a unique identifier automatically generated and assigned to your account).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 User Task Data (Non-Personal Content)</h3>
    <p>This data is the content you create and input while using the Niasn App. While we treat this content with the utmost security, it is not "Personal Data" in the sense of identifying you outside of your use of the App, though it may contain personal information as decided by you.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Content:</strong> All data related to the tasks you create, including task titles, descriptions, due dates, categories, checklists, and completion status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Local-Only Information (Not Collected)</h3>
    <p>The App uses <strong>local notifications</strong> to remind you about tasks. <strong>Crucially, the content and status of these local notifications are generated and stored entirely on your device and are NOT transmitted to or stored on our servers or cloud storage.</strong></p>

    <h3>1.4 Automatically Collected Data (Usage Data)</h3>
    <p>When you access the App, we may also automatically collect certain non-personal information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you access and use the App, such as the type of mobile device you use, its operating system, unique device identifiers, IP address (may be used for general location purposes, such as country), and crash logs. This data is primarily used for monitoring the performance and stability of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To manage your account, authenticate you, and allow you to access and use the task management features of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> To store your <strong>User Task Data</strong> in our secured cloud storage service, allowing you to access your tasks across multiple devices and providing a backup of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, unauthorized access, and fraudulent activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you service-related notices (e.g., policy updates, security alerts, and technical messages) to your registered email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Notifications:</strong> To enable and manage local, device-based notifications to remind you of your tasks. This function runs entirely on your device and does not require server interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> To monitor and analyze usage and performance data to improve the functionality and user experience of the Niasn App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Cloud Storage</h3>
    <p>Your <strong>User Task Data</strong> and <strong>Authentication Data</strong> are stored securely on <em class="placeholder">Firebase</em> located in <em class="placeholder">US</em>. We implement robust security measures to protect this data, including encryption during transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS) and at rest.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We will retain your <strong>Authentication Data</strong> and <strong>User Task Data</strong> only for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App services. If you delete your account, we will initiate the deletion of your personal data and task data from our servers within a commercially reasonable timeframe, unless legal or regulatory obligations require us to retain it for a longer period.</p>

    <h2>4. Disclosure and Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data or user content to third parties. We may share information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our App (e.g., cloud hosting, authentication services, crash reporting). These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example Third-Parties (Self-Select and Customize as needed):</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cloud Hosting: <em class="placeholder">[e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]</em></li>
                        <li>Authentication Service: <em class="placeholder">[e.g., Google Firebase Authentication]</em></li>
                        <li>Analytics &amp; Crash Reporting: <em class="placeholder">[e.g., Firebase Crashlytics]</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred, provided the new entity agrees to adhere to the principles of this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Security of Your Data</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is paramount to us. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your <strong>Authentication Data</strong> and <strong>User Task Data</strong>. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Data Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may have the following rights regarding your Personal Data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> The right to request copies of your Personal Data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> The right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> The right to request that we erase your Personal Data and User Task Data, subject to certain legal limitations.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> The right to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> The right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can typically exercise most of these rights by managing your account settings within the App or by contacting us directly using the information below.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Niasn App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from Children. If you become aware that a Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a Child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We will also inform you via the App or other communication methods prior to the change becoming effective. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
